    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        ISEB/ISTQB qualified with over 16 years of software testing experience working
        across various different development methodologies, taking on various roles 
        including SDET, Quality Engineer, Group Leader (Test Manager), Test Analyst, 
        Test Team Lead, Senior Test Analyst and Test Lead. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have taken myself on a coding journey from a manual tester to a mid level SDET. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I have experience of working in cross functional teams and I am an advocate for 
        quality. I ensure that quality is driven into the development process from 
        refinement of tickets through to delivery. I am confident pairing with developers
        and have the ability to read and write code therefore I can contribute to/write
        unit tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am confident in writing integration tests for API's and 
        can also write API tests through Postman. I was a manual tester for over 14 years
        so have wealth of experience of leading the testing efforts, writing tests, 
        executing and reporting. I also have vast experience of exploratory testing and 
        creating test charters.
